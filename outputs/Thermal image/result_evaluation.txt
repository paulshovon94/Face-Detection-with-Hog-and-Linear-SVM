***Note:After detecting faces in images and videos using Dlibâ€™s HOG + Linear SVM model, 
	there are a few takeaways that we should consider.

	1.Traditional face detection models only work well in simpler scenarios like 
	when the face is almost front facing.
	2.If the face is tilted or away from the camera, the model is not able to detect it.
	3.Occlusions or different dressing style like turbans on the head can also lead to no 
	detection at all.
	4.Upsampling is useful for detection of faces, but the reduction in speed of detection 
	is huge which makes it impractical for real-time use case.
